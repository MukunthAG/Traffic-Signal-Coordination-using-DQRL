Command to generate traffic - python "C:\Program Files (x86)\Eclipse\Sumo\tools\randomTrips.py" -b 0 -e 900 -p 0.25 --route-file roo.rou.xml --binomial 6 -n fixedtime.net.xml

CONCLUSION - 

For 3 signal heavy traffic conditions p = 0.25 => 3600 vph

=> Fixed Time Control > 5000
=> Actuated > 4900
=> Max_pres > 3500
=> Centralised < 2170
=> Multi-agent < 2010

For 3 signal heavy traffic conditions p = 0.3 => 2700 vph

=> Fixed Time Control > 4700
=> Actuated > 4900
=> Max_pres > 3000
=> Centralised < 2100

For 3 signal heavy traffic conditions p = 0.5 => 1800 vph

=> Fixed Time Control > 2975
=> Actuated > 2964
=> Max_pres > 971
=> Centralised < 970
